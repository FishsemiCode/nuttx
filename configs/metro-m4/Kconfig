config METRO_M4_RUNFROMFLASH

	select BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH
	---help---
		This is the normal configuration for building METRO M4 code.

config METRO_M4_RUNFROMSRAM
	bool "Run from SRAM"
	select BOOT_RUNFROMISRAM
	---help---
		During early bring-up, it is safer to execute entirely from
		SRAM until you are confident in the initialization logic.
		Then you can safely switch to FLASH.

		REVISIT:  This auto-selects CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMISRAM but I have
		found, with some difficulty, that that choice still defaults to
		CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH, causing link-time failures when running
		from SRAM.
