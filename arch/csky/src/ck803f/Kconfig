config CK803F_CUSTOM_IRQ_SUPPORT
	bool "Has custom implementation for IRQ handling"
	default n
	---help---
		Allows overriding the standard IRQ processing as described
		in the CSKY CK803F architecture documents.  This allows architecture
		specific code to support non-standard IRQ processing in the core.
