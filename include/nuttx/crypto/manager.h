/* Overview
 *
 * The cryptography manager is a character device that manages cryptography in
 * the full system. Each time the /dev/cryptoman device is opened, a crypto
 * environment is created. Operations and objects executed in the context of an
 * environment are isolated (except for non volatile shared keys).
 * This API is inspired from both PKCS#11 and Javacard, but has been heavily
 * simplified for an embedded environment.
 *
 * Module implementation
 *
 * At boot time, one or more crypto modules can be registered with the crypto
 * manager for later use.
 * A crypto module can be a software implementation running on the CPU executing
 * NuttX, but it can also be an external hardware module, possibly providing
 * extra security.
 * An environment provides a way to enumerate modules and choose the required
 * one.
 * Multiple modules are useful because not all modules are able to provide all
 * algorithms.
 *
 * Only a single module can be active at any moment in any given environment.
 * When an environment is created, no module is active yet. A module can be made
 * active by using CRYPTOIOC_MODSELECT.
 * Note that some modules require authentication (PIN or challenge response
 * based) before being usable.
 *
 * Keys
 *
 * Cryptographic keys are sensitive material. They must be handled with care.
 * This API allows the use of keys without manipulating their value, using key
 * identifiers. Keys can be of two typesÂ :
 *   Persistent keys are retained after an environment is destroyed. They can be
 *     present before any environment is opened. They can be stored in any way,
 *     system FLASH (usually protected), external module, etc.
 *   Volatile keys can be defined in the context of an environment and they are
 *     deleted after the environment is destroyed. They can be retained in any
 *     way, system RAM, external module, etc.
 * Most keys (symmetric keys) have only one component, which is the value of the
 * key.
 * Composite keys like RSA keys have multiple components. If the key is
 * generated at creation, all components are defined at once, else they have to
 * be imported one at a time using CRYPTOIOC_KEYUPDATE. A composite key cannot
 * be used before all its components have been set.
 *
 * Algorithms
 *
 * Each environment can be setup to use a cryptographic algorithm. Once the
 * algorithm is defined in the environment, it can be used to process data.
 * Possible operations are:
 *   Ciphering and deciphering, including a padding for the last bytes
 *   Message Digests
 *   Generation and verification of Signatures
 *   Generation of random data
